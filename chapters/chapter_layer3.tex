% \section{Layer~3 overview}
\subsection*{Capabilities}

The \conceptRef{IP}{Internet Protocol (IP)} allows exchanging \concept{datagrams} 
(Layer~3 \conceptRef{PDU}{PDUs}) between devices from different \conceptRef{LAN}{LANs}.
% 
Its addressing system identifies devices globally and makes it possible to 
\conceptRef{routing}{route} datagrams anywhere we need. 

Devices communicating via IP may belong to LANs
based on different technologies and with different types of \concept{MAC} address.
This has two implications:
\begin{itemize}
  \item A datagram that ``fits'' in the \concept{MTU} of the source LAN
    may be too large for the destination's (or any intermediate's) LAN MTU. 
    IP defines a \concept{fragmentation} system to split datagrams,
    which are reconstructed only at the final destination.\\[-0.25cm]
    
  \item When we send a datagram, we know the target device's \conceptRef{IP}{IP address},
  but not necessarily its \concept{MAC} address. Only if we are part of the destination
  LAN we will need that MAC. IP uses \concept{ARP} to translate known IP addresses
  to MAC addresses of the destination LAN's type.
\end{itemize}


\conceptRef{datagram}{Datagrams} may travel through networks not controlled 
by neither the source nor the destination, so datagrams may be lost, reordered and duplicated.
% 
Layer~3 does not provide mechanisms to deal with this; upper layers must implement
protection mechanisms when required 
(\eg, to implement \concept{TCP}'s \conceptRef{stream}{data streams}).

\begin{center}

\vspace{-0.25cm}
\subsection*{Protocols}

Version~4 of \concept{IP} is \textit{the} protocol used in Layer~3, \ie,
it is common to virtually all communications in the Internet as we know it today.
% 
For many years, the Internet has been struggling to transition towards \concept{IPv6}, 
but the process is not complete and only \concept{IPv4} provides global coverage.

\concept{IPv4} delegates in the \concept{ARP} protocol the translation of known IP addresses 
into MAC addresses within each LAN. ARP does \textit{not} use IP datagrams.

The following protocols encapsulate their \conceptRef{PDU}{PDUs} in the payload of IP 
\conceptRef{datagram}{datagrams}:\\[-0.6cm]
\begin{itemize}
\item Transport Control Protocol (\concept{TCP}) 
\item User Datagram Protocol (\concept{UDP})
\item Internet Control Message Protocol (\concept{ICMP})
\end{itemize}

\begin{remark}
The \inlineCode{ip address}, \inlineCode{ip route} and \inlineCode{ip neighbor} commands 
(among others) let you query several aspects of your IP configuration.
\end{remark}



\section{Layer~3 addressing}

\concept{IPv4} addresses are $32$~bits long. They are most often presented to humans in
the \concept{quad decimal} format, \eg,
\begin{center}
\otherBase{142.250.201.67}
\end{center}

\concept{IPv6} addresses are $128$~bits ($12$~bytes) long, \ie, 
they are $4$~times larger than an IPv4 address.
They are expressed in hexadecimal format, \eg, as follows. Note how 
two colon signs ``\otherBase{::}'' indicate ``fill with zeros'',
and ``\otherBase{::}'' may only appear once per IPv6 address.
\begin{center}
\otherBase{fe80::f524:a73a:e946:7c02}
\end{center}

\begin{remark}
When an \concept{IPv6} address is used as part of an URL, it is surrounded with brackets,
\eg, \otherBase{https://[fe80::f524:a73a:e946:7c02]/}.
\end{remark}


\subsection{Public and reserved addresses}

Most IP addresses are \conceptRef{public IP}{public} and unique across the Internet, 
\ie, the previous IP has the same meaning worldwide: it identifies a single connected device.
% 
Many addresses are \conceptRef{reserved IP address}{reserved/private} and can only be 
used within a particular scope (\eg, a LAN) or situation.
Some of the most common are the following (there are 
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reserved_IP_addresses#IPv4}{\underline{some more}}, 
also for IPv6):

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{ll}
\toprule
\textbf{IP address block} & \textbf{Address scope} \\
\toprule
\otherBase{127.*.*.*} & This computer (localhost) \\[0.1cm]
\otherBase{10.*.*.*} & This LAN \\
\otherBase{172.16.*.*} & This LAN \\
\otherBase{192.168.*.*} & This LAN \\[0.1cm]
\otherBase{0.*.*.*} & Special usages \\
\otherBase{169.254.*.*}& Special usages \\
\otherBase{255.255.255.255} & Special usages\\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\begin{exercise}\ \\[-0.5cm]
\begin{itemize}
\item How many different \concept{IPv4} addresses are there (including reserved and private)? 
\item Are they sufficient now and in the future?
\item Is it problematic that an address like \otherBase{192.168.0.1} 
  is simultaneously used by thousands (likely millions) of computers in the Internet right now?
\end{itemize}
\end{exercise}

\subsection{Netmasks}

The $32$~bits of an IP address can be divided in two parts using a \concept{netmask}:\\[-0.25cm]
% 
\begin{center}
\begin{bytefield}{32}
\bitheader{0-31}\\
\bitbox{10}{Network ID} & \bitbox{22}{Device ID} \\
\end{bytefield}
\end{center}
% 
The first part identifies the LAN or group of LANs to which a device belongs. 
The second part identifies a single device in the LAN. 
The netmask determines how many bits are assigned to each part. 

In the previous figure, the netmask assigns 10 bits to the network ID and 22 to the device ID.
This mask can be anywhere from $0$ (all bits are device ID) to $32$ (all bits are network ID).


Netmasks are presented to humans in two main ways:\\[-0.5cm]
\begin{itemize}
  \item \otherBase{/N}, where $N$ is the number of bits assigned to the Network ID. 
    This is used in the \concept{CIDR} format.
  
  \item The \concept{quad decimal} (\otherBase{A.B.C.D}) format of 
    $N$ bits set to \otherBase{1}, followed by $(32-N)$ bits set to \otherBase{0}.
\end{itemize}

\begin{exercise}
The netmask of the previous example can be expressed in binary 
(although it is not very convenient):
\begin{center}
\begin{bytefield}[bitwidth=1em]{32}
\bitheader{0-31} \\
\bitboxes{1}{1111111111} &
\bitboxes{1}{0000000000 0000000000 00} \\
\bitbox{10}{$10$~bits} & \bitbox{22}{$32-N = 22$~bits}
\end{bytefield}
\end{center}

\begin{itemize}
\item Express the netmask of the previous example in the CIDR and quad decimal formats.
\item What is your IP and netmask? Express it in the same two main ways.
\end{itemize}
\end{exercise}

\begin{remark}
Netmasks are used in IPv6 as well, but with a maximum value of $N$ of $128$ instead of $32$.
\end{remark}

\subsection{Blocks of IP addresses}

Netmasks are used in combination with IP addresses to define 
\conceptRef{IP address block}{blocks of IP addresses} 
that begin with the same $N$ bits (where $N$ is the netmask).
% 
For instance, \otherBase{192.168.3.0/24} (in \concept{CIDR} format) 
and \otherBase{192.168.3.0/255.255.255.0} refer to the block 
of addresses between \otherBase{192.168.3.0} and \otherBase{192.168.3.255},
both included
(\otherBase{192.168.3.*} in the informal notation of the previous table).

\begin{exercise} 
IP blocks can be smaller than, equal to or larger than an IP network.
Provide examples where an IP block refers to:
\begin{itemize}
\item A single IP.
\item Half the IP addresses in the \otherBase{192.168.3.0/24} network.
\item All addresses of the \otherBase{192.168.3.0/24} network, plus 
      $256$ more addresses.
\item All possible IPs.
\end{itemize}
\end{exercise}


\begin{exercise}\ \\[-0.65cm]
\begin{itemize}
\item Can every \concept{netmask} be expressed as an \concept{IP address}?
\item List all possible netmasks.\\[-0.5cm]
\end{itemize}
\end{exercise}

When referring to a block of addresses (like a LAN), 
the IP address in this IP + netmask combination
must have all device ID bits set to \otherBase{0}. 
This way, \otherBase{192.168.3.0/24} correctly refers to a network, but
\otherBase{192.168.3.1/24} refers instead to a device 
(the one with IP \otherBase{192.168.3.1}) in that network (\otherBase{192.168.3.0/24}).

\subsection{LANs and netmasks}

Netmasks need \textit{not} be multiples of $8$. Consider the following example in which \\
\otherBase{192.168.76.1/19} (a device's IP + netmask) is used to obtain its network address\\
(\otherBase{192.168.64.0/19}):\\

\begin{center}
\begin{bytefield}[bitwidth=1.1em]{32}

\bitbox{8}{192} & \bitbox{8}{168} & \bitbox{8}{64} &\bitbox{8}{0} 
\end{rightwordgroup}\\
\end{bytefield}
\end{center}

\begin{exercise}\ \\[-0.5cm]
\begin{itemize}
\item In the previous example, we only really needed to transform one decimal value to binary,
and one decimal value to binary. Which one?
\item Is this always true when converting IP+netmask combinations to network addresses?
\item Express the netmask in \concept{quad decimal} format.
\end{itemize}
\end{exercise}



Given a IP + netmask address block and a device's IP address, it is direct to determine 
whether that device's IP belongs to the block (if and only if the first $N$ bits match,
where \otherBase{/N} is the CIDR netmask).

\begin{exercise}
Determine whether each of the following addresses belong to the same network as
the following device \otherBase{123.45.67.89/14}:
\begin{itemize}
\item \otherBase{23.45.67.89}
\item \otherBase{123.45.203.25}
\item \otherBase{123.43.255.255}
\item \otherBase{0.45.67.1}
\end{itemize}
\end{exercise}

An \conceptRef{network}{IP network} (a LAN) is a block of addresses, but not all those addresses 
can be assigned to devices. Two addresses are always reserved:
\begin{itemize}
\item The address with all node bits set to \otherBase{0}: it identifies the LAN itself.
\item The address with all node bits set to \otherBase{1}: it identifies \concept{broadcast} within the LAN.
\end{itemize}

\begin{exercise}\ \\[-0.5cm]
\begin{itemize}
\item List all addresses that can be assigned to devices in \otherBase{192.168.54.0/29}.
\item List the broadcast address of that network.
\end{itemize}
\end{exercise}

The netmask \otherBase{/N} determines the number of devices that can be connected at the same time
to a network: $2^{32-N} - 2$. When LANs are called ``small'' or ``larger'', the size refers to that 
number of available device addresses. 

Conversely, the number $M$ of devices that we need to connect to the same LAN determines the 
smallest LAN size (largest netmask \otherBase{/N}) that fits all those devices at the same time:

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{ccc}
\toprule
\textbf{Netmask} & \textbf{Total addresses} & \textbf{Max devices} \\
\otherBase{/N} & $2^{32-N}$ & $2^{32-N} - 2$ \\
\toprule
\otherBase{/30} & 4 & 2 \\
\otherBase{/29} & 8 & 6 \\
\otherBase{/28} & 16 & 14 \\
\otherBase{/27} & 32 & 30 \\
\otherBase{/26} & 64 & 62 \\
\otherBase{/25} & 128 & 126 \\
$\vdots$ & $\vdots$ & $\vdots$ \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\begin{remark}
All \conceptRef{router}{routers} need a valid IP address per LAN to which they are connected.
Therefore, routers \textit{do} count towards the maximum number of devices connected in a LAN.
\end{remark}

\begin{exercise} \ \\[-0.5cm]
\begin{itemize}
\item What's the minimum network size that fits $256$ connected devices?
\item What's the longest netmask \otherBase{/N} that would let everyone in your city connect?
\item How many addresses are contained in a \otherBase{/0} network? 
\item How many \otherBase{/0} networks may exist? Are they given names?
\end{itemize}
\end{exercise}


\begin{exercise}
The following code snippet takes an IP address and shows its $4$~bytes expressed in 
quad decimal and in binary.
Extend (or replace) the code so that you can:
\begin{itemize}
\item Transform $32$ bits into a quad decimal string.
\item Display a netmask in IP address and CIDR formats.
\item Given a device's IP and netmask, determine whether other IP belongs to the same network.

\section{IP -- Internet Protocol}

\subsection{Packet format}

\concept{IP} defines a \concept{packet} format with a \concept{header} 
that is \textit{at least} $20$~bytes long. Optional parts may be included,
as long as the total header size is a multiple of $32$~bits ($4$~bytes).
The payload can be empty, so the minimum datagram size is $20$~bytes.\\

\begin{center}
\small
\begin{bytefield}[bitheight=3.4em,bitwidth=1.1em]{32}
\bitheader{0-31}\\

\end{rightwordgroup}
\end{bytefield}
\end{center}

\begin{exercise} \ \\[-0.5cm]
\begin{itemize}
\item How can the payload length be calculated from the header?
\item What is the maximum payload length?
\item What are the possible values of the flags in the IP header?
\item What's longer, an IP address or an Ethernet MAC address?
\item Is it possible to send exactly 17 bits of payload data in an IP datagram?
\item How can we know whether a datagram is encapsulating TCP or UDP data?
\item Why must the optional header part by a multiple of $32$~bits?
\end{itemize}
\end{exercise}

\subsection{Operation}

When a device A wants to send an IP datagram to a device B, the source and 
destination IPs in the header are fixed and don't change for this datagram.

If devices A and B belong to the same LAN, the datagram is sent directly
(\eg, encapsulated in an Ethernet frame). However, IP can go much farther.
Consider the following scenario, where A wants to communicate with E.

\begin{center}
 \includegraphics[width=0.5\linewidth]{ip_operation_example.pdf}
\end{center}


Here, the source and destination devices belong to different LANs.
The datagram is passed first to the source's \concept{router}.
Then, each intermediate router passes it to the next one until the datagram reaches 
the last router, which is connected to the destination LAN. Finally, that last router 
passes the datagram to the destination. 

\begin{center}
\includegraphics{ip_operation.eps}
\end{center}

The source and destination IP addresses don't change throughout the journey.
In contrast, MAC address change in each LAN \concept{hop}. 


\subsection{Routers and forwarding}

\conceptRef{router}{Routers} are the devices in charge of forwarding IP \conceptRef{datagram}{datagrams}
by looking at the destination IP address of each one, present in the IP \concept{header}. Routers don't need 
to \concept{decapsulate} headers of layers 4 and above. Therefore, they network stacks need contain only up to Layer~3
(and so are sometimes referred to as Layer-3 devices).

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.9\linewidth]{forward_layers.pdf}
\end{center}


When a router detects a network frame $F$ in one of its \conceptRef{interface}{interfaces} (network cards),
it tries to recognize the following parts of a datagram.
\begin{center}
\begin{bytefield}{48}
\bitbox{12}{Layer~2 header} & \bitbox{12}{IP header} & \bitbox{24}{Datagram payload}
\end{bytefield}
\end{center}
If recognized, the router processes the datagram as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
\item The whole frame $F$ is discarded unless the destination MAC (in the Layer~2 header) 
  is that of the router's interface that detected the frame.\\[-0.25cm]
  
\item The router looks at the destination IP address (in the IP header of $F$) and at its \concept{routing table} 
  to decide the next \concept{hop} of the datagram, \ie, the device to which this router will pass 
  the datagram to, and what \concept{interface} to use (see Section~\ref{sec:layer3:routing} below).\\[-0.25cm]
  
\item The router creates and sends a frame $F'$ making the following two changes to $F$:\\[-0.25cm]
  \begin{enumerate}[label=\alph*)]
  \item The Layer~2 header in $F'$ changes entirely:
    \begin{itemize} 
    \item The destination \concept{MAC} is that of the next hop,
    and the source MAC is that of the router forwarding the datagram.
    The next hop's IP is given by the \concept{routing table} (see Section~\ref{sec:layer3:routing}), 
    and its MAC is obtained from that IP using \concept{ARP} (Section~\ref{sec:layer3:arp}).\\[-0.4cm]
    %     
    \item The source MAC of $F'$
    frame is different from the destination MAC of the received frame $F$ if the router 
    received $F$ in one interface (\eg \inlineCode{eth7}) and forwards it through another 
    (\eg,  \inlineCode{eth9}).
    \end{itemize}
    
    \begin{center}     
    \vspace{0.15cm}
    \includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{router_ports.jpg}
    \vspace{0.15cm}
    \end{center}
    
  \item The IP header in $F'$ differs from that of $F$ in the following:
    \begin{itemize}
    \item The \concept{TTL} (time to live) field is decreased by $1$.\\
    If the TTL reaches $0$, the datagram is discarded instead of being forwarded.
    \item When the \conceptRef{IP Options}{Options} field is present, it is often updated.
    \item The header \concept{checksum} is updated accordingly.\\
    \end{itemize}
  \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

\begin{remark}
 Note how the IP addresses and the payload are copied over unmodified
  when a datagram is forwarded.
\end{remark}


\subsection{Routing, subnets and supernets}\label{sec:layer3:routing}

When a router receives an IP \concept{datagram} to forward and that router 
is connected to the same LAN as the destination IP address, the router performs a \concept{direct delivery} (DD).
% 
Otherwise, the datagram is forwarded to the next router in an \concept{indirect delivery} (ID).
% 
A router knows whether to perform DD or ID, as well as the destination (and source) IP address to use,
thanks to its \concept{routing table}.

All route tables have at least the following columns:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Destination address block}: one or more IP addresses that can be expressed as an IP + netmask combination.
  A row in the table may apply to a datagram only if its destination IP is within that row's destination address block:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item If only one row of the table applies, that row is used for routing.
  \item If more than one row applies to a datagram, the row with the smallest destination address block 
    (the most specific) is used.
  \end{itemize}
  A destination block of \conceptRef{default routing table}{\textit{default}} indicates the \otherBase{0.0.0.0/0} block.
  Since this is the largest block possible, it is only applied if none of the other rows apply. 
  The \textit{default} entry is not mandatory.\\[-0.3cm]
  
\item \textbf{Gateway/via}: if the row corresponds to an \concept{indirect delivery}, this column contains the IP address
  of the next router. Otherwise, this column contains \otherBase{0.0.0.0} to indicate a \concept{direct delivery}.\\[-0.3cm]
  
\item \textbf{Interface}: internal name of the network interface (\eg, of the Ethernet card) to use to deliver the 
  datagram. Operating Systems may use any convention they wish, as long as they can be uniquely identified in the table.
\end{itemize}

\begin{remark}
All devices have their own routing table, not just routers.
\end{remark}

\begin{exercise}
The \concept{routing table} of a small router is presented next.

\begin{center}
\vspace{0.2cm}
\begin{tabular}{ccc}
\toprule
\textbf{Destination address block} & \textbf{gateway/via} & \textbf{Interface} \\

\item Draw a network map consistent with the routing table, containing this router.
  For the router's interfaces, indicate its name and some valid IP and Layer~2 addresses.\\[-0.3cm]
  
\item How would this router forward a datagram directed to a \concept{public} IP address?\\[-0.3cm]

\item Provide a destination IP address that would be processed using the \otherBase{10.49.4.0/28} row,
and another that would be processed using the \otherBase{10.49.4.2/32}. 
Think of a use case for having these two rules.
