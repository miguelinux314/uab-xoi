\section*{This Guide}

This guide is designed to help you progress through all parts of the ``Computer Networks and Internet'' (XOI) course.

Here you can find written materials, exercises and other tools to make the most of your effort and help you acquire
valuable skills. It is strongly recommended that you become familiar with this guide and use it all throughout the semester, starting
the very first week of class:

\begin{itemize}
\item During the lectures, we will use it to present and refer to new and previously visited concepts. 
      We will also use it to drive activities and problem sessions.\\[-0.3cm]
      
\item At home, it can help you gather and organize new knowledge, as well as to find useful exercises to practice
      your newly acquired skills.\\[-0.3cm]
      
\item After you complete the course, it can be useful as an index of contents and pointers to useful reference materials.
\end{itemize}

\begin{remark}
This guide is not a book, a reference material or even a complete set of class notes, and
\textbf{it is not intended to substitute your own notes}. 
The guide's goal is rather about presenting you with new, interesting questions than about providing complete answers.
This guide does not substitute continuous, active class attendance and autonomous work at home.
Instead, you are encouraged to use the guide to help you understand the lectures, and vice-versa.
\end{remark}
