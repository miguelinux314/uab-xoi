About 75 years ago, a top-secret expedition was sent through space with the goal of colonizing another planet. The expedition arrived safely at their destination, but the landing broke their communication instruments, leaving them stranded. You are a third-generation colonist, engineer-to-be, and this is the first mission assigned to you by the assembly:
share the new and shiny \mbox{calculator}. \textbf{Please read everything \mbox{carefully}}.\\

\noindent
\begin{remark}
\textbf{Important}: Each student is encouraged to post a \textbf{formal report} (in PDF) in the ``Mission 1 exchange forum'' of the Campus Virtual before the next 2h session. After that, we count on you to post a \textbf{formal reply letter with feedback} (also in PDF) for at least one other solution, before the following 1h session.
\end{remark}

\subsection*{Report details}

Right now, the colony consists of 3 separate bases (3 buildings). These bases have 3, 200, and 5000 electronic devices, respectively. The base with 3 devices has been built specifically to house a new, powerful and power-hungry calculator (it is one of the 3 devices). Everyone in the colony wants to have access to the calculator, but none of the devices have network capabilities \textit{yet}. Your goal is to propose a convincing networking design that connects and satisfies everyone.\\

\noindent
Prepare a brief report with your design, proposing clear and complete solution proposals to the following points:

\begin{enumerate}[itemsep=0.25cm]
\item How is the \textbf{analog-digital barrier} crossed to allow digital communication? Be concrete in the technologies you propose.
\item How are the devices physically connected? Provide a diagram with the exact \textbf{topology}.
\item What \textbf{addressing system} will be used to uniquely identify each device? Give two address examples, one of them being the new calculator's.
\item What \textbf{packet format} will the devices employ? Provide a concrete format diagram and the bytes of a full, example packet.
\end{enumerate}


\subsection*{Feedback details}

After posting your solution to the forum, find another one and \textbf{claim it} by replying to it with a short ``I will provide feedback'' message (one feedback letter per solution).\\

\noindent
Then prepare a formal letter in PDF and post it to the same thread once it's ready (you can find an example feedback letter in the Campus Virtual). In this letter, include your feedback (both positive and negative), explaining anything you deem relevant or think it can help that solution.  Make sure to touch on the following points:

\begin{enumerate}[itemsep=0.25cm]
\item Do you see any major flaw or incomplete point that would prevent the proposal from becoming reality?
\item If you did your report again, would you adopt any of the proposals of this solution?
\item Could you interpret the contents of the message included in the report? Include the bytes of a possible response, based on your understanding of that report.
\end{enumerate}
