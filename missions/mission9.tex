Thanks in part to your help configuring the colony's network and services,
your colony is thriving with cultural and scientific activity. The main hallway of your colony's interplanetary spaceport sees thousands of visitors from different planets every day.
These visitors demand quick and simple Internet connectivity from this hallway,
and the colony assembly has appointed you to help with the configuration.

\subsection*{Report details}

The assembly has asked you to configure a DHCP server for the passenger devices.
The Autonomous System number 7847 is gracefully lending you the highest $1024$ addresses of their block, which will be the ones provided by this service.\\

\noindent
Every $2$ hours, a ship with up to $300$ people (each with a single, Internet-hungry device) arrives at the spaceport. Some depart immediately while others stay longer in the spaceport, but at most $1000$
devices need to be connected at the same time.
%
Right before the spaceport begins operation in the morning, all addresses managed by the DHCP server must be available for leasing, because the first $5$ ships are completely full.

\begin{enumerate}[itemsep=0.25cm]
\item Find out who is generously lending you the $1024$ public IP addresses, and what their full block is.

\item Provide an updated routing table for router $\textrm{R}_0$. This is the router directly connected to the colony's \mbox{HugeAntenna\texttrademark}, the North and South Buses, and now to the new LAN dedicated to passengers. You may assume this new LAN is connected to a newly added interface.

\item What is the longest Lease Time you can configure that is compatible with the morning rush? Justify your answer.

\item Using swimlane diagrams, provide a concrete scenario in which the maximum of $1000$ devices is simultaneously connected at some point during the rush hour. Indicate how many messages of each DHCP subtype are involved.

\item If a passenger hid in the spaceport terminal during the night, what mechanism would you use to ensure their assigned IP address is available for leasing the next morning?

\end{enumerate}


\subsection*{Feedback details}

Consider similar requirements and process as in the previous missions, making sure to touch on the following key aspects:
\begin{itemize}
\item Is the routing table correct, and as simple as possible?
\item Did you find a longer Lease Time that is compatible with the requirements?
\item Do you see any issue with the $1000$ concurrent device scenario description?
\end{itemize}
